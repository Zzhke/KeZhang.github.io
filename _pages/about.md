I am a master candidate of [College of Informatics](https://coi.hzau.edu.cn/) in [Huazhong Agricultural University](https://www.hzau.edu.cn/), supervised by assistance of Prof. Han Li. I receved the B.S. degree in Shanghai Maritime University in 2022. My research interest is machine learning, including federated learning (especially in vertical federated learning), asynchronous parallel optimization, scalable kernel methods.
